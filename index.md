# Welcome to discord.py-self!
This site will serve as a home for the project. 

Here you'll find the documentation, code-snippets, blogs, notes, and everything in between!
Check out the [about](/about.html) page to learn more about the project, or read the [docs](/docs/)!

What's the phrase that I'm repeating in my sleep? 
> The Discord API is a steaming pile of unpredictable hot garbage.

Happy self-botting!
